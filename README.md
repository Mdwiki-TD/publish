# Overview

This repository manages the final steps in the process of publishing Wikipedia articles that have been translated using the [ContentTranslation tool](https://github.com/mdwikicx/cx-1) in [medwiki.toolforge.org](http://medwiki.toolforge.org/). It takes the translated text in wikitext format, refines it further, and then publishes it to Wikipedia.

# Workflow

1.  **Pre-processing with fix_refs:** Before reaching this repository, the translated wikitext undergoes pre-processing using the [fix_refs](https://github.com/Mdwiki-TD/fix_refs) tool. This tool performs tasks such as:
    *   Fixing and standardizing reference formatting.
    *   Expanding infoboxes.
    *   Adding categories.
    *   Correcting other minor wikitext issues.

2.  **Publishing to Wikipedia:** After `fix_refs` has finished, this repository takes over. It is responsible for:
    *   **Preparing the Wikitext:** further preparing the wikitext for publishing.
    *   **Handling any user configurations or custom settings**.
    *   **Automating the publication process to Wikipedia:** This involves interacting with the Wikipedia API to create or update pages.
    * **Manage the log**: save the logs for later checking.
    *   **Error Handling:** Implementing mechanisms to handle potential issues during the publishing process, such as API errors or conflicts.
    * **Validate the data** ensuring that all information is in the correct format.

# Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to automate and streamline the final publication process of translated Wikipedia articles, ensuring they are correctly formatted, categorized, and successfully published on Wikipedia.
